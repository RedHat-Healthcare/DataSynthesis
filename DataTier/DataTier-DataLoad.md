# DataSynthesis Loading Seeded Data
The easiest thing we could have done is make this a complete SaaS based offering.
We are cognizant of the potential for partners to build out  
potential services offering down the road. We also want to ensure that organizations can have control  
of the data.

## MySQL
These can be found within MySQL/DataSeeding. The scripts for simplicity are  
quasi hard coded. We have tested them on a few OS'es. However, with OS and MySQL security  
enhancements always keep in mind there might be changes needed.
The intent of the Data Seeeding is to support both a very large data tier DataSeeding-Full: initially that can grow
(but starts in the billions). Also, a much smaller footprint for containers and very small testing DataSeeding-Small.

As with everything we do we keep the complete history so everyone can see the work that has been done.

Linux (CentOS/RHEL/Mac)
-----------------------
[Base-DataLoader-DataSynthesis-<LatestVersion>-Linux.sql](MySQL/DataSeeding/DataSynthesis-Load-Full/Base-DataLoader-DataSynthesis-v9-Linux.sql)

Steps to Run The Scripts:
1. Open Terminal Window
2. Make sure all the scripts into a specific defined directory that aligns with what is defined for the
shell being used, for simplicity I put everything into the subdirectory DataSeeding. Then make sure the
directories have correct permissions, I used chmod 777 to ensure correct permissions (it is understood that
that these are very open permissions and system admins might not allow this level.
3. From the command prompt run the mysql cli with the complete path to the scripts:
/Applications/MySQLWorkbench.app/Contents/MacOS/mysql -u root -p
< /Users/mac-beast/Development/DataLoads/DataSeeding/DataSynthesis-Load-Full/Base-DataLoader-DataSynthesis-v9-Linux.sql

Windows
-------
[Base-DataLoader-DataSynthesis-<LatestVersion>.sql](MySQL/DataSeeding/DataSynthesis-Load-Full/Base-DataLoader-DataSynthesis-v9.sql)

Steps to Run The Scripts:
1. Start MySQL Command Line Client
2. Establish a connect to mysql typically with something like mysql -u root -p
3. source <MySQLLoadScript>.sql


Happy coding!!!
