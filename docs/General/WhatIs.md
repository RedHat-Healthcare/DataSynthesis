## What is Data Synthesis
<p>
For years companies have focused on most aspects of development, from the tooling to developing the next generation of solutions to support their business needsand provide value. As everyone in the software development and delivery industry has seen
development processes might be the same but the tools and capabilities that can now be delivered have grown exponentially in the last few years alone. So with all these new capabilities whats the next step after the software is crafted? What
advancements have been made in testing processes, that yield better software more rapidly, that is more usable from the outset, with fewer risks to your data? No many!!!! Data and testing always seems to be viewed as the same practice and processes
from decades ago. How and why is this the case? Data is the electricity that powers business and the cornerstone of companiesâ€™ success in the digital era. With data being so critical what is your companies focus on the need for meaningful testing data?
Any thoughts or strategic initiatives towards becoming a test data-driven organization? A test data-driven organization is an organization that can leverage data for their testing needs and that data accurately represents their needs. To be a data-driven
organization requires an overarching testing data culture that couples a number of elements, including high-quality production like data, broad access and data literacy along with appropriate data-driven decision-making governance and guidance processes.
Companies that are successful in this space are quick at using data for all aspects of their business needs successfully and are quick to spot opportunities, quick to assess ideas and adapt quickly to test, learn and drive future capabilities and needs
from these experiences.

A data-driven organization does not have to come at a high price. While it sounds complicated it really involves providing businesses a means for data collection, cleansing, hosting and maintenance data while mitigating the risk of a data breach thru
comprehensive testing processes and practices. Data-driven organization can innovate continuously because they understand and can embrace new business
models quickly. As we think about how organizations mostly test today its by hooking up production feeds to test systems and typically getting sign-offs from security and various other IT management officers. Why should orgainzations
risk data breaches or the potential leakage of PHI (in healthcare) or PII (In any other industry) ? In today's technology world these old practices does not make ANY practical sense. We introduced a new and different way to be
able to innovate within a data-driven organization, synthetic data.

Synthetic data is defined as "any production data applicable to a given situation that are not obtained by direct measurement" according to the McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Scientific and Technical Terms; where Craig S. Mullins,
an expert in data management, defines production data as "information that is persistently stored and used by professionals to conduct business processes." With these definitions it is easy to understand the creation of synthetic
data is an involved process that can be achieved by numerous measures and ways. Our way was to create a platform to synthesize data (Data Synthesis) for multiple needs based on items like industry standards, vendor data models,
custom defined models all in an on-demand manner.

The Data Synthesis platform is designed to generate, leverage and build upoin one hundred percent freely available information and augment or construct it for various business needs. In no way is anything produced from data
synthesis native production data. The idea for Data Synthesis is in NO WAY new or unique, it comes from the struggle that every organization with every resource on every project I have ever worked on. There are always
struggles with getting and using real-world representative data. While there are several potential offerings that might help, they all have issues or varying limitations. So how do you get comprehensive, high quality
synthetic data, that is as close to your production data as possible? Data Synthesis purpose is to help create a test data platform that supports:

- Enterprise-wide data,
- Industry standards,
- Vendor-specific, and custom-designed data and models,
- On-demand access (tDaaS),
- External data from any source,
- Microservices/API access,
- Any/multiple layers of metadata
- Leverage the latest technology and be able to build out capabilities that accurately represent production data without exposing it

This technology is intended to democratize complex industry standards metadata and enable efficiency in the testing and validation process of technology.
