## Data Offering(s) Within the Platform
Data is the key part of this technology. DataSynthesis is built on the concept of data attributes - core data the platform has in it.  
Data attributes are the center piece of the the platform and the platform is geared around supporting, sustaining and growing these.  
The key part to the platform and its capabilities is how we tie data attributes into something larger and reuseable, data structures.  
To support this within DataSynthesis we built in support for composite data structures. This means platform users can develop these and  
they will be able to be distributed to others within the technology. Our intent was to simply provide a mechanism where these structures  
could be leveraged and then easily offered within the technology.

The platform currently has the following data attributes available within it:

- Account Numbers
- Addresses
- Area Codes
- Bank Accounts
- Bank Routing Numbers
- Companies
- Credit Cards
- Date of Birth
- Drivers License Number (50 State compliant formats)
- Employer Identification Numbers
