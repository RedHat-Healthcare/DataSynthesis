# History of DataSynthesis
<p>
DataSynthesis was born after its creator received three patents for de-identification. Its sole intent is
to provide a comprehensive reusable hybrid platform for anyone in need of massive amounts of data for
development, testing or other data related activities. The key to the entire platform is ALL the data
that is provided within it initially is completely fictitious and was at some time publicly available.

As you read through this content and think "There's no way there's that much data within it our of
the box?" Just think about how data is constructed. Because the core of the system is about data
attributes that enables us to legitimately use a force multiplier for data elements. Aldo, keep in
mind that we have core tables in place to store lots of these options as well.<br>

A few examples of how to look at the base data provided:<br>
- Names: The construct of a name is by at a minimum combining a first name and last name. The base platform contains almost **300k first names and almost 600k last names**. So, out of the box that means it has well over **16.5B** name combinations.
- Addresses: Addresses are constructured from an Street Adrress and a location (City/State/Zip). We also have international zip codes but have not found an open source. Because Addresses are generated within the platform and can have up to 6 potential output styles.
  However, if you have 70k initial addresses and the platform comes with all 43k zip codes in the US then that means
  you have **301M** combinations to start with.

<br>
While we can go on and on you get the idea, there is a TON of data here initially. Also, keep in mind the platform has a large series of data generator so these can be run to grow the base data, the only limitation is your storage and processing!!!!
