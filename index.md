## Licensing and Pricing Model
Data Synthesis has always intended to be operated under the open/community source model. This means we are providing the code for  
community enhancements and improvements to support the growth of underlying data access capabilities. The code assets include the  
Web UI, APIs and the core repository patterns used to access the data structures offered within the platform. DataSynthesis  
open source licensing model is Apache 2.0.



## How is Data Synthesis a Platform?
This technology is designed around enabling capabilities. Capabilities are built as subsystems, this  
design enables various features to be delivered for capabilities to be addressed. These subsystems  
together form the entire software platform.<br>
