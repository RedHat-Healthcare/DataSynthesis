# DataSynthesis
The DataSynthesis Platform and all relevant solutions for it. Each key
solution is represented by a different high level directory and within
each of these directories is some artifact that can be used. Within
various repositories once they are downloaded these directories can be
individually opened and the code within them mmanaged, modified and run.

Within this solution please find a few specific directories:

* DataTier - all the supported Data Tiers and ANY content is contained within this
* Java-APIs - This is a newer effort developed in Quarkus to provide the platform APIs. This also contains all the needed services as we rebuild them to manage and do platform tasks.

Specific Readme.md files

* [DataTier Readme](https://github.com/RedHat-Healthcare/DataSynthesis/blob/master/DataTier/README.md)
* [Java API Readme](https://github.com/RedHat-Healthcare/DataSynthesis/tree/master/Java-APIs)


*Enjoy and Happy Coding!!!*
